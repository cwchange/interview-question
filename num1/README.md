(1.) Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Foo” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Bar”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FooBar”. Example output: 1 2 Foo 4 Bar Foo 7 8 Foo Bar 11 Foo 13 14 FooBar …


(2.) Write a function that counts the number of even numbers that appear in a range of integers 0..n, where n is supplied as the sole argument to your function. Example: even_integers(3) 1



(3.) Given the following pseudo code, determine the range of possible values for “a” in your language of choice:

x = random_int(1,6)

y = random_int(1,6)

z = random_int(1,6)

a = x + y + z



(4.) Given: words = [‘one’, ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘three’, ‘two’] Remove the duplicates



(5.) Print to stdout the following output using only one loop:

1 1 1 1 1

2 2 2 2 2

3 3 3 3 3

4 4 4 4 4

5 5 5 5 5



(6.) Write a method that finds the largest sum of consecutive entries in an array given a group size.  It should take an array and the interval size as inputs and should return both the largest sum and the index of the first entry in the group. For example, in the following Array [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2] given a group size of 2 the result would be a maximum sum of 3 and a position of 6.
